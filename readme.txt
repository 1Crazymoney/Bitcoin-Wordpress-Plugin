= Our Statement about Bitstamp, Mt Gox Bitcoin Exchanges (January 2015) = 

The above companies kept the client's bitcoins on their servers. And this caused the problems.
Our GoUrl.io Bitcoin Payment Gateway is Fully Secure and as additional security we do not keep any client's money (bitcoins, altcoins) on our servers. All received payments are automatically forwarded to client's external wallet addresses within the next 30 minutes. We use industry-leading technology (such as SSL encryption) to keep your transaction information safe. This gives additional protection to our customers against hackers, etc.
